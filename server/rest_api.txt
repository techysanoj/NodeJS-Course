Restfull API
    - types of API which have some set of standards when client send a request to server and server sends a response.
    - response can be anything text, image, json, html, etc.
    - There are some rules:
        1. Works on the client-server architecture.
        2. Client should not be dependent on the server. Means simply send the response in the JSON format.
        3. Always respect all HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.  
            Like if anyone give GET /users then it simply read from DB not update the DB or anything other than read operation.
            means all the operation should be same as the request method.
        so while sending the response using express js like res.send(), res.json(), res.render() etc.
        so here we are using Server Side Rendering (SSR).
