"dependencies": {
    "express": "^5.1.0"
}

here version is ^5.1.0
basically there are three digits in each version
1st 5
2nd 1
3rd 0

a. last part - Minor fixes
    optional updates means it does not do anything serious on the app
    so if we do not update to the latest version then it will not affect the app.
    means lets say if we get 5.1.1 then it is not required to download

b. middle part - Recommend fix (security fix)
    lets say from 5.1.0 to 5.2.0
    means we need to download this immedietly and download this as much early as possible

c. first part - Major release
    lets say from 5.1.0 to 6.0.0
    means if we download this then it may happen our app will run or may not run
    Major or Breaking updates 
    means if we are making new application then we can download this but for current one we need not do this

we can install a particular version for a particular package using
npm install express@4.17.1 like this


what does the ^ this symbol means in the version?
    - it means compatible with version
    - like epxress = ^4.18.2
    - so means it can change from 4.0.0 < 5.0.0
    means it will not change 4 to 5 automatically
    - install all recommended and minor fixes automatically
    - if we remove ^ then it will not update any minor or recommended fixes

what does the ~ this symbol means
    - like ~4.18.1 so it will only change the 3rd part(last part) 
    - like it can go to 4.18.2 .3 and so on but not 4.19.0 like this


we can use >=, range and so on accordingly
4.0.0 - 4.9.9
>= 4.1.1 <5.0.0 like this
|| or symbol is also there
we can also use 4.1.x (here x can be anything )
latest means we can use latest version when we do npm i
