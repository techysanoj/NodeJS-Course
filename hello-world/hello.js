// you can run this in terminal using node hello.js
console.log("hey there i am js"); 

// you can run this in browser console as well

// this will give error in terminal
// console.log(window); 
// problem is that DOM or Window related elements are not available in node environment


// we need to do npm init -y
// it will create the package.json file
// package.json file contains metadata about the project
// we can change the name and version in package.json file and add scripts like we create start script
