MongoDB
- NoSQL Document based database
- Strong support for aggregation pipes
- Works on BSON format
- Best for Node Applications.

on broader we have collection in MongoDB
like collection - "users"
and in each collection we have document like doc1, doc2, doc3 and so on.

Go to official website to download this: 
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/?macos-installation-method=homebrew&operating-system=macos

These are some of the commong commands which you need to remeber
1. show dbs: shows all the databases
2. use <db_name>: select the database 
3. show collections: what are the collections present in this database
4. db.coll.find(): to find anything on the collection like db.users.find({})
5. db.coll.insert(): to insert anything in the collection like db.users.insert({"name: sanoj", "heheh"})

to use MongoDB in node we need to install a library in it named npm i mongoose 

1.  require the mongoose package
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");
2.  Create the schema
    const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        first_name: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        last_name: {    
            type: String
        },
        email: {
            type: String,
            required: true,
            unique: true
        },
        gender: {
            type: String
        },
        job_title: {
            type: String
        }
    }, {timestamps: true});

3.  Create the Model
    const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema); // name of the model, schema

4.  Connect to the mongoose db
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/youtube-app-1').then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
    .catch((err) => {console.log("Error in connecting to MongoDB", err)});
