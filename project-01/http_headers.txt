For example lets say a person wants to send a mail to another person and then that person sends a reply to it

also we need addtional information on the mail like address, weight, etc actual data will be there also
so these additional information are called headers.
and those data are called packets.

Headers:
    - HTTP Headers are an importan part of the API request and response as they represent the meta-data associated with
      the API request and response.
    - Headers carry information for the request and response body.

    like example: 
    sec-ch-ua
    "Chromium";v="140", "Not=A?Brand";v="24", "Brave";v="140"
    upgrade-insecure-requests 1
    user-agent
    Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/140.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

    - We can change the request and response headers accordingly
    - Middleware check the request headers and then work accordingly
    - Best practise:
        1. Custom Headers, always add X to custom headers like X-MyName
