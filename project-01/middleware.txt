Middleware
    - lets say client request to server (on a particular route) and it will send the response
    - overall middleware comes in between these
    - Client -> Middleware -> Server and then Server -> Client 
    - And using the middleware we can do processing on the request if anything goes wrong in the request middleware directly
      sends the resopnse.
    - It is a function which takes request, process it, response directly or send the request to the server.
    - It can have multiple middleware like client -> m1 -> m2 -> m3 -> server like this.
    - It also have access to the response object.
    Function:
        1. Execute any code
        2. Make changes to the request and the response object.
        3. End the request response cycle.
        4. Call the next middleware function in the stack using the next().
